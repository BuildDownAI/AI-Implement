# Codex parity validation (provisional)

This page records the evidence for Codex support and what is still unproven. It does not claim complete Codex parity.
AII-1289 owns the final Codex + Restate acceptance and stays open; closing it must replace each pending row below with
accepted evidence. This page does not waive them.

Operator procedures: [model-account-operations.md](model-account-operations.md). Template markers:
[workflow-envelope.md](workflow-envelope.md). Planning isolation: [pipeline-architecture.md](pipeline-architecture.md).

## Verified: code, synthetic and native-CLI evidence

None of these used live credentials or paid model calls.

| Area | Evidence | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Local administration preview | Operator-approved synthetic preview on 2026-10-16 (AII-967/968). Real browser saves persisted defaults and the project opt-in/override, restored the inherited preview, and left the OTHER project unchanged. Local SQLite only; no dispatcher, no external fetch. | AII-967, AII-968 |
| Managed GHA workflow capability | Final head `2014a251`: 513 focused template/dispatch tests passed, then 322 after a move-only docblock correction; typecheck and build passed; CI/review current. Canonical and mirrored template pairs are byte-identical. | AII-970 |
| Trusted planning skills policy | Final head `d248884ac5f4476ed5c69ff4b80f50c6aa54250b`: 109 focused tests passed (4 unrelated skips); typecheck and build passed, independently. | AII-1169 / AI-Implement#1175 |
| Native CLI run | Claude 2.1.284, Codex 0.159.2, image `sha256:d8a31b74e210140540300c5a5141b215c2aebe6bcbe55a9b77548be9cc3cf323`, private `BuildDownAI/codex-sandbox-repo` commit `49f12b97884f3507b26ab63daab1e99931bf15f9`. Network none, loopback synthetic protocol provider. Production `setupPlanningWritePolicy` generated all CLI args and plugin paths. | AI-Implement#1175 |
| Claude planning, normal case | Skill loaded; Bash and Edit unavailable; a Markdown Write outside the comments directory denied by the production hook; an allowed comments Write succeeded. | AI-Implement#1175 |
| Source exclusion | A skill with only a quoted hook was excluded (`sourceHookExecuted=false`). Canonical normal and `..selected-home` workspace sources excluded; symlink and ancestor tests pass. | AI-Implement#1175 |
| Repository content | With hooks-bearing `.claude/skills` and `.claude/commands` inside the private checkout, `system/init` advertised the trusted plugin but neither repository entry. Explicit Skill calls returned Unknown skill; `repoSkillLoaded`, `repoCommandLoaded` and `repoHookExecuted` were all false. | AI-Implement#1175 |
| Codex planning view | Real production view/argv: `skills/list` found the synthetic proof skill with mode 444, strict config, and no thread or turn started. | AI-Implement#1175 |

Caveat: both pinned CLIs also advertise their own bundled vendor/system skills. The exclusion guarantee covers unselected
external user, project and repository content, not the absence of the trusted CLI's built-ins.

Exact commands and output are in the AI-Implement#1175 body and the latest verification comment on AII-1169. Evidence for
the other feature children (AII-1169 through AII-1181) is recorded on their own PRs; only claims verified there belong here.
Deployment and target workflow sync have not occurred.

## Limited historical evidence

TEST-2 supplies limited Fly/ChatGPT proof: exit 0 with error telemetry, then approval, with the original stream cause
unknown. It is not the final matrix. A successful automatic Restate review-fix in this campaign ran on Claude/GHA; that does
**not** prove Codex.

## Pending: paid/live acceptance

Each pending row needs an exact run ID, frozen snapshot ID and head SHA recorded when it is accepted. Nothing is accepted
until those are present.

| Case | Status | Required evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Six backend/auth cases (every supported backend x auth pairing) | Pending | Per case: run ID, snapshot ID, head SHA |
| Mixed-stage runs (Claude and Codex across planning/implementation/review) | Pending | Run ID, snapshot ID, head SHA per stage |
| Codex on Restate: restart recovery | Pending | Live run ID, snapshot ID, head SHA |
| Codex on Restate: cancel | Pending | Live run ID, snapshot ID, head SHA |
| Codex on Restate: uncertain launch | Pending | Live run ID, snapshot ID, head SHA |
| Codex on Restate review-fix, live | Pending | Live run ID, snapshot ID, head SHA |

Managed Restate review-fix admission still refuses until AII-1335/1336. AII-1338 is generic Fly proof, not Codex-specific.
AII-1289 owns the final Codex-specific evidence.

## Release order

1. Reviewed prerequisite integration to testing (credentials and GHA capability).
2. The existing sequence AII-1368 → AII-1312 → AII-1374 → AII-1313, under D10/John.
3. Final AII-1289 matrix completion afterward.

This order adds no scheduler, backend architecture or bypass.
